----- I did not look for no_tremor. Jan included everything in no_tremor (including unknown activity)

S01_on_move
0-50 med activity
* 276-end tremor
around 284 artifact in one of the LFP channels
difficult to draw conclusions about the powers

S01_on_hold
no tremor, apparently, no clear changes in EMG
tremor power oscillates with 1Hz approx
(note the scaling of EMG plot is bad because of EMG artifact in the middle 151-152)

S01_off_hold
* 0-203 tremor
231-242 med activity in only one of the EMG chans
LFP beta is larger after tremor
during tremor there is a period when it often bursts, but generally quiet
in MEG more wide spectral activity before the end of the tremor?

S01_off_move
* 105-117 tremor (not marked by Jan)
* 119-164 tremor (larger than whan Jan points)
there is perhaps stronger beta before first tremor episode
there is also some event beteween the two (almost contiguous) tremor episodes
if one shorts second tremor a bit, its dissappearance correlates with apparance of LFP beta and lowering of MEG activity

S02_off_move
* 10-113.5 tremor
* 213-234.5 tremor
Есть какая-то доп активность beta in the LFP in the beginning of tremor
for the second episode there is also smth in MEG
There is short pause in tremor around 50 and something happens in
LFP tremor and beta, also in MEG gamma
LFP tremor looks weird
in the begininng of second tremor there is LFP tremor and beta increase

S02_off_hold
* 0-4 tremor
0-144 there is some high EMG activity
42-101 medium-clear tremor (lots of noise)
* 101-134 clear high amplitude tremor
* 134-145 low amplitude tremor
there is pronounced LFP activity in the very first short episode in the beginning,
and also towards the part with the most high amplitude tremor
LFP tremor rises before the end of the tremor

S02_on_hold
* 0-33
* 33-113
* 113-208
* 224-274  small tremor
tremor pause around 33, accompanied by strong beta and gamma in MEG
there are mauch more activity before 71 in all LFP
LFP tremor has bullshit

S02_on_move
* 0-14  low amplitude tremor
* 109.7-152 pronounced high amplitude tremor
* 156-184 -- low amplitude (continues up to 199)
220-238 some EMG activty
246-48 -- artifact in one (not main) LFP channel
high LFP activity during strongest tremor, higher MEG activity towards the end of the strong tremor period

S03_off_hold
[jan lables are correct here]
* 55-64 tremor
* 108-128.2 tremor
a bit less gamma during tremor?

S03_off_move
EMG has rythmicity 1.5Hz
* 95-105 tremor?
* 113.6 - 117.7 tremor
* 133 - 149.5 tremor
* 152.6 - 157.9
* 184.7 - 194.3
* 208-211.4
85-89 small activity  one channel only
123-126 med activity one channel only
169-171 med activity one channel only
228-230 med activity one channel only
242.3-245 high activity
there are strange not-like-tremor events in one channel only that have strong correlate in MEG tremor, EMG tremor _band_ and MEG tremor band are correlated


S04 off hold,  [right hand]  
* 0-11 tremor
11-180 small acitivity
180-194.7 -- 4 bursts, with 2.3 sec interval approx
195 first larger furst
197 large burst
* 198 - 243 tremor  [if looking at tremor power in EMG, then it ends later, at 248]
244-248 large activity
248-274 med activity
274-end smal activity with occasional bursts, > several sec separation
124.2-129 -- LFPL23, LFL12 artifacts
289.6-291.1 -- LFPL23, LFL12 artifacts
177-180 -- LFPL12, LFPL01 -- maybe aftifact, but less evident
spectral EMG characteristics of two tremor episodes are different


S04_off_move [ some LFP channels don't have spectral data. Need to redo]
62-74 LFPL12, LFPL01, LFPL23 artifact
255.7-256   LFPL12, LFPL01, artifact
261.5,266.5   LFPL12, LFPL01, artifact
275.8,278   LFPL12, LFPL01, artifact
* 83-95  tremor
* 107-150 tremor
* 154-169 tremor
* 178.5-185 tremor
185-255 -- med & small activity in EMG
293-end small activity in EMG
17-56 small activity in EMG
65-81 small activity in EMG

apparently during tremor (at least some time after start) there are less beta in LFP, more beta during small EMG activity outside explicit tremor
between tremor episodes there is some small-med activity in EMG

S04_on_hold
* 0-91.8 -- tremor
142.2-143.2 -- large short burst
156.5-end large EMG activity
228-240.3 -- LFPL23, LFPL12 artifact
during med and large EMG activity there is enhanced LFP low beta apparently

S04_on_move
  EMG channel 61 is more characterisitc here
0-36 medium activity in EMG, but not as rythmic as tremor perhaps. Or maybe it is?
160-178  medium activity in EMG, but not as rythmic as tremor
* 178-193.8 tremor
* 193.8-201 tremor?
* 207-216.5 tremor
216.5-261 some small activity in EMG 61
LFPL12, LFPL01 are weak first 2/3 of the recording

-----------------
-----------------
S05_off_hold
* 0-9
* 18.3-32
* 42-70
* 118 128   small tremor
* 134-140.5
* 188 - 206.7
* 209 - 246 (maybe need to separate into small and large tremor)
* 252-271.4
Here its rather cloear that LFP activity is weaker during tremor
there is a lot of beta after the tremor stop
tremor has a clear monotonically increasing trend during episodes and then dies out quick

S05_off_move
*0-14
*47.5-51 small tremor
*58-80
*124-135
*180-190
*232-242
*247.5-267.7
271-274.6 med activity
there is a lot of beta after the tremor stop

S05_on_hold
0-84 rather high activity
84-127.6 med-low activity
<<< rly?? >>. 237.6 - rest -- low activity
1-82.6 -- lots of LFP artifacts (all channels)  artifact_LFPL01, artifact_LFPL12, artifact_LFPL23

S05_on_move
15-17 LFP aftifact (all LFP chans)
45.9-48.2  LFP aftifact (all LFP chans)

[put into json]

S06_off_move
13-22  small activity
34-45  aver activity
61-69  aver activity
116-122  aver activity
122.5-169 -- several spisodes of aver activity
172-181.7 -- aver activity
261-268 small activity

S06_on_move
276-280 MEG aftifact?
238-244 MEG aftifact??

S07_off_hold
*0-8 (or maybe till 7.7 if I want to see high beta after the end)
* 64-81.5
* 85-102
102-178.3 -- high activity. Maybe tremor  [and after that there is something in the LFP)

S07_off_move   [one of MEG src is bad]
*33.7-38.4  weak tremor
*166-171.7  weak tremor [and up to 200 some small tremor-like stuff]
*155-159.7   weak tremor
*257-267.7   sparsly appearing tremor
0-24 no tremor
40-54 no tremor
61-84 no tremor (thought there's smth in the middle, but really small)
96-120 no tremor (thought there's smth in the middle, but really small)
126-154 no tremor
there very weak tremor-like stuff in other parts of EMG as well
There are bursts of bursts of LFP pretty randomly, not very correlated to tremor

S07_on_hold  [for some EMG tremor band is large > 1 often, maybe need to reduce threshol, or way we set limits;  one of MEG src is bad]
41-44 MEG artifact
*0-45 tremor
*85.3-273 increasing tremor [239-273 munch weaker tremor] [241-256 increase of beta when tremor already fades away]
273-end no tremor
46-85 no tremor

S07_on_move
*0-44.8 tremor
*53-120.8
*126.3-142.3 tremor [ there's beta increase around 127 that may be related to prev tremor episode, then I'd shift the start of the current one to 130 or so ]
*280-

S08_on_rest
203-208 -- artifact?

S09_off_rest
tremor increases from zero to max (around 24s) and stays there until 189j


S10_off_move [all MEG are bad]
0-20 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
*22.3-43 tremor
67-96 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
103-117 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
119.8-135 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
144-156 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
158.3-228 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
243.7-274 strange EMG bursts, perhaps not tremor
  prominent tremor band in LFPL01 almost all time

S10_off_rest
there is really strong activity during tremor
Ask Jan: 63-66 is an artifact or not?


--------------
---------------   non main side

  S01 tak LFPL01
S01_off_hold
any LFP will do

S01_on_hold
LFPL23 had more strange peaks other two are similar

S01_on_move
LFPL12 and 01 have more peaks, but not so strange
LFPL23 artifact 267.9-268.7

  s02 mabye LFPL23
[not all S02]
S02_on_move
119-120.3, 121.8-122.7, 124,124.7, 128-129.5, 140-143.8    artifact all lfps
162.85-163.3  -LFPR01
246-248 LFPR23

S02_off_hold
LFPL12 more active in tremor than others
LFPL23 makes strange tremor upward after tremor ends
292-292.7 LFPL * artifact
296-end  LFPL * artifact
 
   S04  LFPR12
S04_on_move
LFPR23 seem to have something to do with tremor existence (not intencity). Or maybe more with heartbeat?
LFPR12 shows funnier things (but not creepy)

S05_on_hold 
some smaller MEG artifacts in the second half of the 300 sec part, I did not label them

S05_on_move
EMG activity almost all time, not quite like tremor
